Horiseon's SEO webpage:
The main code for the webpage. This website focuses on Horiseon's application and deployment of search engine optimization. 
This webpage gives all the information provided by Horiseon to build their ideal website to reach existing customers and inform potential customers about
their services.

This website uses a combination of HTML and CSS to build and style it.

The application is straight forward to use, downloading it only gives you a preview of the same code you could get by inspecting the elements in Chrome.

This website was built in conjunction with the UCI continuing education bootcamp. The basic framework was provided by the instuctors for us students to fix
and get a better grasp on what goes into working on websits. 

Major credits for help with bugs goes to https://www.w3docs.com/, with their extensive library of sample code I was able to properly solve many of the 
issues I encountered while working on this project.
